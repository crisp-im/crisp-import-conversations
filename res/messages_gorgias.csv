56939495,Cancellation,"Hello Patrick,

Your subscription was indeed taken out in February for 1 year, which is why you still have the October / November / December and January books included in your subscription.

I also see that you're on manual renewal, which means that you won't be renewed when your subscription expires unless you validate the payment on your side.

Have a nice day.
